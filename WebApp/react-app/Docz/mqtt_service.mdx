# mqtt_service
> A node backend to access AWS's S3 bucket. Calls to S3's endpoint to retrieve a list of device data then acts as an endpoint
for the React app to access the information. Starts a local server on port 3001 and retrives data from S3 and responds with a JSON
object holding messages from the Pi.

## Notes
>This file will be removed in the future in favor of react directly calling to the S3 endpoint.
